MVC is used to create websites. In this case, controllers typically return a view (i.e., the HTML response) for browser requests.

Web APis, on the other hand, are made to be consumed by other applications. If you want to allow other applications to access your data/functionality, you can create a Web API to facilitate this access. For example, Facebook has an API to allow application developers to access information about users using the application.

The main difference between the project types is that the MVC project type adds web-specific things like standard CSS, JavaScript files and other resources required for a website, which are not required for an API.
